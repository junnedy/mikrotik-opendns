This will also need you to configure scheduler entry for periodical runs (maybe every 5 minutes or so). 
You will probably want a second scheduler event run this script upon RouterOS startup.

If for whatever reason the update fails, the script will not update DNSoMatic until the IP address changes again. 
This is rare, but could happen. 
It would be recommended to set up a third scheduler with longer intervals (maybe 1 hour) to run a script with the following code:




:global previousIP;
:set previousIP ""

:log info "Cleared previousIP to force DNS-O-Matic update on next run."
